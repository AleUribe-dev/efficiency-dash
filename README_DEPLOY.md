# Engineer Task Efficiency Analyzer — Deployment

This app is a Streamlit webapp. You can deploy it for free using **Streamlit Community Cloud** or **Hugging Face Spaces**.
Your main script is `efficiency_webappv6.py` (rename to `app.py` for convenience).

## Option A — Streamlit Community Cloud (easiest)
1. Push your files to a public GitHub repo:
   - `app.py` (your Streamlit script)
   - `requirements.txt` (from this folder)
   - Any assets you need (optional)
2. Go to https://share.streamlit.io → *New app* → select the repo/branch/file (`app.py`).
3. Click **Deploy**. The app will build and be live in a few minutes.
4. If you use secrets (e.g., API keys), set them in **App → Settings → Secrets**.

Notes:
- File uploads are supported; for large files, suggest zipping first.
- If you want a custom subdomain, set it in the app’s settings.

## Option B — Hugging Face Spaces (also easy)
1. Create a new **Space** → **Streamlit** template.
2. Upload:
   - `app.py`
   - `requirements.txt`
3. The Space will auto-build and go live.
4. To keep it private, set the Space visibility to **Private**.

## Option C — Render / Railway (container-style)
1. Keep `app.py` and `requirements.txt`.
2. Add a `Procfile` with:
   ```
   web: streamlit run app.py --server.port $PORT --server.address 0.0.0.0
   ```
3. Create a new **Web Service**, point to your repo, and deploy.

## Local Test
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```
Open the printed URL in your browser.

## Naming
- If your current file is `efficiency_webappv6.py`, either rename it locally to `app.py` **or** configure the deploy UI to point to that file.
